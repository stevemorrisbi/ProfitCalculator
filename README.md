# Profit Calculator

### The notebook 'ProfitCalculator.ipynb' contains a Python function designed to calculate profit in pounds when selling items.

#### Conditional logic will be added to this function at a later date to categorise whether a purchase is a worth while investment or not. 

#### The current logic will be developed to include currency conversions. Conditonal logic of including US sales tax is also be a future development.
