# Profit Calculator

### The notebook 'ProfitCalculator.ipynb' contains a Python function designed to calculate profit in dollars or pounds when selling items.

#### Conditional logic will be added to this function at a later date to categorise whether a purchase is a worth while investment or not. 

#### Conditonal logic of US sales tax will also be a future development consideration.
